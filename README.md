## ðŸ’» Reflection


- This project was very challenging yet very rewarding. I could learn so much and apply all that knowlegde on my personal projects. 

- Conditionally redering styles and flipping booleans using the NOT (!) operater were definitely something new for me. However, what I've enjoyed the most, was to be able to learn about data-attributes and using an EventListener for the whole app.


- Skills learned: e.target.id, filter( ), includes( ), data-attribute, conditionally rendering styles, flipping booleans using the NOT (!) operator, and CDNs.
